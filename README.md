# ðŸ§  SOC Home Lab Using Microsoft Sentinel

A hands-on cybersecurity project that builds a **Home SOC (Security Operations Center)** in Microsoft Azure.

This lab demonstrates how to deploy a **honeypot virtual machine**, collect and analyze security logs with **Azure Log Analytics**, and visualize attacker activity using **Microsoft Sentinel**.

---

## ðŸ§© Project Overview

This project simulates a real-world SOC environment in the cloud.  
You will:
1. Deploy a **Windows 10 honeypot** on a free Azure account.
2. Expose it to the internet to attract live attack traffic.
3. Forward logs from the VM to **Log Analytics Workspace**.
4. Connect **Microsoft Sentinel (SIEM)** to analyze attack data.

## ðŸš€ Technologies Used

- **Microsoft Azure** (Free Subscription)
- **Virtual Machines (Windows 10)**
- **Azure Log Analytics Workspace**
- **Microsoft Sentinel (SIEM)**
- **Azure Monitoring Agent**
- **KQL (Kusto Query Language)** for querying logs
- **PowerShell / CMD**

## ðŸ“ˆ Results
- Captured thousands of real login attempts from global IPs  
- Identified brute-force patterns and common attacker regions  
- Created visual dashboards in Sentinel for analysis

---

## ðŸ§© Lessons Learned
- Exposed systems get attacked within minutes of going live.  
- Centralized logging and visibility are key to incident detection.  
- Cloud-native SIEMs like Sentinel make analysis efficient.
